\section{Roles}

\subsection{Arbiter}

The arbiter is a machine-only role.
There may be at most one arbiter in the game.
The arbiter must reveal their role at the start of the game.

Every round, the arbiter gets to nominate up to \(fN\) players, where \(N\) is the player count and \(f\) is the faction ratio.
All nominated players lose their right to participate in control phase votes for this round only.
They are, however, still obligated to follow the results of the vote that occurs in their control phase.
