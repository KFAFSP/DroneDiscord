\chapter{Drones}

% Definition.
A \termdef{drone}[Drone] is an \termref{in-game}[Game] actor on the \termref{battlefield}[Battlefield] that can execute \termref{actions}[Action].

\section{Attributes}

% Definition.
Every \termref{drone}[Drone] has the same set of attributes with different actual values.
All attribtutes must be initialized at the start of a \termref{game}[Game], and influence how the \termref{drone}[Drone] performs on the \termref{battlefield}[Battlefield].

\subsection{Owner}

% Definition.
The \termdef{owner}[Drone!Owner] of a \termref{drone}[Drone] is the \termref{player}[Player] that has control over it.
As the owner is invariant, many properties of the \termref{drone}[Drone] carry over to the \termref{player}[Player] and vice versa.

\begin{rules}
    \rule{drone.owner.init}
    \begin{stmts}
        \stmt{} Drone ownership is assigned at the start of the \termref{game}[Game].
        \stmt{} Every \termref{player}[Player] takes control of exactly one \termref{drone}[Drone].
        \stmt{} Every \termref{dron}[Drone] belongs to exactly one \termref{player}[Player].
    \end{stmts}
    \rule{drine.owner.const} Drone ownership remains constant throughout the entire \termref{game}[Game].
\end{rules}

\subsection{Incapacitation}

% Definition.
An \termdef{incapacitated drone}[Drone!incapacitated] is a \termref{drone}[Drone] that can no longer execute \termref{actions}[Action].

\begin{rules}
    \rule{drone.incapacitation}
    \begin{stmts}
        \stmt{} Incapacitated drones may not execute \termref{actions}[Action].
        \stmt{} When a \termref{drone}[Drone] becomes incapacitated, its \termref{owner}[Drone!Owner] is \termref{eliminated}[Player!eliminated].
    \end{stmts}
    \rule{drone.incapacitation.init} At the start of a \termref{game}[Game], no \termref{drone}[Drone] is incapacitated.
\end{rules}

\subsection{Health}

% Definition.
The \termdef{health}[Drone!Health] (\HP{}) of a \termref{drone}[Drone] indicates how much \termref{damage}[Trigger!Damage] it can take before it becomes \termref{incapacitiated}[Drone!incapacitated].

\begin{rules}
    \rule{drone.health}
    \begin{stmts}
        \stmt{} When a \termref{drone}[Drone] takes \termref{damage}[Trigger!Damage], its health is decreased according to the \termref{damage value}[Trigger!Damage].
        \stmt{} Drone health is not reduced below \(0\).
        \stmt{} When drone health reaches \(0\) at any point during the \termref{game}[Game], the \termref{drone}[Drone] becomes \termref{incapacitated}[Drone!incapacitated].
    \end{stmts}
    \rule{drone.health.init} Every \termref{drone}[Drone] starts the \termref{game}[Game] with \(10\) health.
\end{rules}

% Unit.
The health of a \termref{drone}[Drone] is measured in integer health points, with one health point being denoted as \SI{1}{\healthpoints{}}.

\subsection{Location}

% Definition.
The \termdef{location}[Drone!Location] of a \termref{drone}[Drone] shows which \termref{tile}[Map!Tile] on the \termref{battlefield}[Battlefield] it occupies.

\begin{rules}
    \rule{drone.location}
    \begin{stmts}
        \stmt{} Every \termref{drone}[Drone] has a location indicated by \termref{tile coordinates}[Map!Coordinates].
        \stmt{} Every \termref{tile}[Map!Tile] can be occupied by at most \(1\) \termref{drone}[Drone].
    \end{stmts}
    \rule{drone.location.init} At the start of the \termref{game}[Game], every \termref{player}[Player] assigns any valid location of their choice to their \termref{drone}[Drone].
\end{rules}

\subsection{Traits}

% Definition.
The \termdef{traits}[Drone!Trait] of a \termref{drone}[Drone] modify its behavior \termref{in-game}[Game], adding special \termref{triggers}[Trigger] for for its \termref{owner}[Drone!Owner].

\begin{rules}
    \rule{drone.traits.init} Every \termref{drone}[Drone] is randomly assigned zero or more traits at the start of the \termref{game}[Game].
    \rule{drone.traits.secret} All traits assigned to a \termref{drone}[Drone] are \termref{secrets}[Secret] of their \termref{owners}[Drone!Owner].
    \rule{drone.traits.const} All trait assignments are fixed throughout the \termref{game}[Game].
\end{rules}

\subsubsection{Role}

% Definition.
A \termdef{role}[Role] is a \termref{drone trait}[Drone!Trait] that is tied to a particular \termref{faction}[Faction]

\begin{rules}
    \rule{drone.trait.role} A role may only be assigned to a \termref{drone}[Drone] \termref{owned}[Drone!Owner] by a member of the role's \termref{faction}[Faction].
