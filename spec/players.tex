% Explanation.
All \termref{hidden secrets}[Secret!hidden] are subject to communication restrictions between \termref{players}[Player].
For example, they protect the confidentiality of the actions of opposing faction members.

\begin{rules}
    \rule{player.secret.revealed}
    \begin{stmts}
        \stmt{} If the rules state that a \termref{hidden secret}[Secret!hidden] is revealed, it must be announced to all \termref{players}[Player].

The player allegiance is the most important \termref{secret}[Secret] of a \termref{game}[Game].
Additionally, it is randomly assigned to every \termref{player}[Player], so that it cannot be deduced from any other initial \termref{game state}[Game!State] information.

\begin{rules}
    \rule{player.allegiance.init}
    \begin{stmts}
        \stmt{} Player allegiances are assigned randomly at the start of a \termref{game}[Game].
